You do not have to use davepmer's kernel but your kernel must support bck for wifi to work

first
start clean ./clean-build.sh
start build ./start-build.sh
apply patches ./patch.sh 
now you need to choose, if you want F2FS or not.  
if you want F2FS ./F2FS.sh 

if F2FS was applied but you want ext4 then ./ext4.sh
